# testify
File-based unit testing runner for Nim

This projects covers the need of a unit testing system which can produce a report out of multiple files/modules.  
In big projects, you need to seperate your tests in multiple files, and some of them might not even compile!  
As output you get a unified JUnit file with results from all your test files.
